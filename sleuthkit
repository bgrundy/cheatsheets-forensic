# The sleuthkit (TSK) is a collection of tools basically ordered
# according to the "layer" of analysis they work on:
# (This cheatsheet covers basic tools - not all TSK tools are
# covered).
#
# General TSK tool usage:

# Most TSK tools work on file systems
#  - need to pass -o <offset> found with mmls
#
# TSK will support the following image formats if the
# corresponding library is installed (auto detected)

 - EWF (E01, etc.) - using libewf
 - VHDI (Virtual Disk - VHD) - using libvhdi
 - VMDK (Virtual Disk - VMDK) - using libvmdk

# Media Management Layer
mmls   # Display volume layout of a disk

# File System Layer
fsstat # Print the file system statistics
fls    # List the contents of directories

# File Name Layer
ffind  # Find the name of a file given the meta-data

# Inode (metadata layer)

istat  # Display details of a meta-data item (MFT entry, EXT inode, etc.)
icat   # Stream the data blocks associated with a meta-data item
ifind  # Find the meta-data item given the filename or data unit.

# Block layer

blkstat # Display details of a file system data unit
blkcat  # Stream the specified volume data block
blkls   # Output volume data units (unallocated by default)
blkcalc # Convert between and unallocated block address and the block 
        # address in an original image
