# Output file system data units (unallocated by default)
#  -e  (every block [entire file sysetm])
#  -a  (all allocated blocks)
#  -A  (all unallocated blocks [default])

# The <offset> to the file system (in sectors) is from mmls output.

blkls -o <offset> <image> 

# Example:

$ blkls -o 2048 image.raw > unalloc.raw

# The above example outputs all unallocated data block from
# image.raw and stores them in unalloc.raw for separate
# processing.
