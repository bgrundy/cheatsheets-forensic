# Convert and copy a file - Can be used for forensic imaging.
#  if=<input_device>       (source device)
#  of=<output_file>        (destination file)
#  bs=<blocksize>          (set read and write block size)
#  count=<numblocks>       (number of blocks to read/write)

# Create a simple single file image of a disk:

dd if=/dev/sdc of=image.raw

# The same but with progress shown:
dd if=/dev/sdc of=image.raw status=progress

# Create a simple single file image of a disk starting at sector
# 2048:

dd if=/dev/sdc of=image.raw bs=512 skip=2048

# Read the partition table (DOS MBR) of a disk and pipe to xxd
# for viewing.  Partition table is at offset 446 and is 64 bytes
# in length:

dd if=/dev/sdc bs=446 skip=2048 count=64 | xxd

# To Create a split image with 2GB file sizes and .000, .001, .002... extension
# we can use the "split" command with -d (numerical extension)
# -a3 (3 digit extension) -bXG (each split is XG in size) and a
# lone dash '-' to indicate input is coming from the pipe:

dd if=/dev/sdc | split -d -a3 -b4G - image.split.
