# Disk unit mapping between unallocated an normal images
#  -u  (calculate block address from unallocated image [from blkls])
#  -s  (calculate block address from a slack image [from blkls -s])
#  -d  (calculate block address from a raw image [from dd or #  similar])

# The <offset> to the file system (in sectors) is from mmls output.

blkcalc -o <offset> -[dsu] <data_unit> <image> 

# Examples:

$ blkcalc -o 2048 -u 23693 image.raw
47996

# In the above example:
 - 23693 is the address of an unallocated unit in blkls output
 - 47996 is the address of that same data unit in the full image.raw
