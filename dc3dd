# To Create a simple single file image of a disk:

dc3dd if=/dev/sdc of=image.raw

# To Create a split image with 2GB file sizes and .000, .001, .002... extension:

dc3dd if=/dev/sdc ofs=image.000 ofsz=2G

# Same as above but with a sha256 hash and logfile:

dc3dd if=/dev/sdc hofs=image.000 ofsz=2G hash=sha256 log=image.log

# To wipe a device with zero's:

dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdx
